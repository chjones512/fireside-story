        	<p>It was a dark and stormy night in what used to be downtown St. Louis...</p>
		<p>The Automatomotons had already taken the Hill, and were marching south towards FOB delta.</p>
		<p>Commander Birnston was slowly steeping his tea and in deep thought, when the road suddenly erupted in flames.</p>
